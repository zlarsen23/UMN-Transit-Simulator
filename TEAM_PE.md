# Team Policies and Expectations

## Instructor's Expectations and Responsabilities for All Students

### Project Iteration Responsibilities of the Team (as a Team)
* Together, determine the distribution of work and design this distribution so that it is possible for each team member to contribute a roughly equal effort toward the success of the project. Make your best guess about this at the start of the project, and refine the responsibilities if needed as you go. Consult the instructor if any issues arise or you need clarifications.

#### Distribution of Work
**Step 1: Please, provide here a brief description (one short paragraph) of the distribution of work across your team. You can refine this description as you carry out the project iteration.**

### Project Responsibilities of the Individual
* Individually, contribute to the success of the team according to the policies and schedule agreed upon by all team members. Individually, create the opportunity for everyone in your group to succeed at being a good team member - don't do all the work yourself.

## Additional Expectations and Responsabilities Set by The Students
Establish your own additional team policies around the following aspects:

* Expectations for regular group meetings and synchronous class/lab attendance.
* Expectations for frequency, method, and response time for communication on Piazza.
* Expectations for using other forms of electronic communication.
* Expectations for frequency of contributions to the project.
* Expectations on how to communicate when things are not working as we expected.
* Others.

#### Additional Expectations and Responsabilities
**Step 2: Please, describe here (using as much text as you need) additional expections and responsabilities for this project iteration**.

## Team Member Names
**Step 3: Please enter your name. Each one of the team members should add the name through a different commit. For example, student A adds their name and commits, then student B adds their name and commits.**
